# CSUP-Mobile-Application

Case Study project at University of Donja Gorica "Making Android WeatherApp for Montenegrin beaches".

### Project Overview

The main idea of this project is to create a mobile application that will focus on providing information on weather conditions (weather, wind, rainfall, etc.) on Montenegrin beaches. In addition to this basic information, the user will be able to access graphical views for weather information. In order to achieve self-sustainability and cost-effectiveness, one of the segments of the app will also be an advertising space, primarily Google Ads service, so that we can later use the same space to advertise specific places near the beaches. Considering that tourism represents a large share of GDP in Montenegro, we can see the advancement of the application in measuring data at various places such as ski resorts, national parks and other places of tourist importance. We can also improve this application by measuring new parameters e.g. measuring the water temperature of beaches, lakes and rivers, then measuring the number of people in locations to avoid places with too many people (this is very important for ski resorts and beaches).
